# Design Document: Automated Backup and Restore System

## Objective
To implement an automated backup and restore system that securely backs up specified directories, encrypts the backup, and allows for easy restoration when needed. The system will include robust validation, error handling, and the ability to schedule backups using cron jobs.The system includes a local and remote backup to consolidate reliability.

## Key Components

### 1. Backup Functionality
- A shell script named `backup.sh` will be used to perform backups.
- The script will accept parameters for source directories, destination directory, encryption key, and backup period (n days).
- It will validate inputs using the `validate_backup_params` function, ensuring they meet the required criteria.
- Backups will be created in separate compressed tar files for each source directory and in a combined tar file for all the files in source directories.
- The script will utilize `tar` for creating and updating archives.

### 2. Validation and Error Handling
- A `validate_backup_params` function will ensure that input parameters are valid.
- Error messages will be generated for incorrect inputs or missing directories.
- The script will exit gracefully if validation fails.

### 3. Scheduled Backups with Cron Jobs
- A cron job will be used to schedule regular backups.
- The user will specify the frequency and timing of the cron job.
- The system will automatically initiate backups according to the defined schedule.

### 4. Encryption
- Backups will be encrypted using GPG for security.
- A function will handle encryption with the provided encryption key.
- Encrypted backup files will have a `.gpg` extension.

### 5. Restoration Functionality
- A shell script named `restore.sh` will facilitate data restoration.
- The script will accept the encrypted backup file and the decryption key.
- It will decrypt the backup file and restore the contents to the specified destination.

## Benefits

1. **Data Security:**
   - Backups will be encrypted to ensure data security.
   - Only authorized personnel with the decryption key can access the backup content.

2. **Automated Backups:**
   - The cron job functionality ensures regular, automated backups without manual intervention.

3. **User-Friendly:**
   - Error handling and validation ensure correct inputs.
   - Restoration is made easy with the `restore.sh` script.

4. **Efficient Use of Resources:**
   - Incremental updates and intelligent backup creation reduce resource usage.

## Implementation Steps

1. Define the `validate_backup_params` function for input validation.
2. Create the `backup.sh` script to handle backup logic, utilizing `tar` and GPG encryption.
3. Implement the `restore.sh` script for data restoration.
4. Test the scripts thoroughly, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
5. Set up cron jobs for scheduled backups based on user-defined timings.
6. Document the usage, parameters, and instructions for running the scripts.

## Conclusion

The proposed automated backup and restore system provides a robust solution for data protection, efficient resource utilization, and user-friendly operation. With advanced validation, encryption, and scheduled backup capabilities, this system ensures the reliability and security of critical data. By implementing this system, we can establish a consistent and automated backup strategy that mitigates the risk of data loss and streamlines the data restoration process.

This design document reflects our comprehensive understanding of the technical requirements and showcases our ability to design and implement a sophisticated backup and restore solution using Bash scripting and analytical thinking. The proposed system addresses data security, automation, and user convenience, making it a valuable addition to our infrastructure.
